Simple, idiomatic Ruby wrapper for the League of Legends API. Very much a work in progress. I've decided to release it while unfinished in order to gather feedback about the interface, and what features you would all like to see.

Installation:

gem install vigor

Usage:

vigor = Vigor::Client.new("Your API key")
dyrus = vigor.summoner("dyrus")
wildturtle = vigor.summoner(521955)

wildturtle.id
=> 521955

wildturtle.mastery_pages
=> [List of MasteryPage objects]

wildturtle.mastery_pages.first.current?
=> false

Full documentation and more complete feature set coming very soon!
